# It is important to note that we will select random houses too to test your implementation with.
# So if you want to be sure you cover all cases, you could also run the code with all 80 households.
# For this, you can uncomment the following code:

# cfg_houses = {}
# for i in range(0, 80):
    # # Make a config for each house number i (see the for loop iterator)

    # # To do so, we make a new dictionary (called h) witht he config for a house
    # h = {
        # # PV configuration
        # "pvpanels":  1,  # Number of panels, integer
        # "pvazimuth": "south",  # Available options: east, southeast, south, southwest, west
        # "pvtilt":  30,  # Available options: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50

        # # Wind turbine configuration
        # "winddiameter": 1,  # Diameter in metres

        # # Battery configuration
        # "batminsoc":    0,  # Minimum state of charge in kWh
        # "batcapacity":  4,  # Capacity in kWh
        # "batsoc":       0,  # Initial State of Charge at start of simulation in kWh
        # "batpmin":      -3000,  # Minumum power (discharge is negative) in W
        # "batpmax":      3000,  # Maximum power in W
    # }

    # # We add now h to our dictionary with house configs
    # cfg_houses[i] = h

    # # Note that on the next iteration the h "memory" is overwritten, this is a programming trick.
