# This function simulates the behaviour of the device

# Function arguments:
#
# Input:
#   - ev:       Object representing the data structure of EV properties (see comments below)
#   - planning: A vector (list) representing the planned power values per interval in Watts
#
#
# Returns:
#   - profile: A vector (list) representing the actual power consumption per interval (per your implemented algorithm) in Watts
#
# Notes: 
#   - the length of profile (i.e., number of elements) must equal the lenghth of the planning list (input)
#   - With default settings this is 672 elements (7 days times 96 intervals (of 15 mins) per day)
#   - Do not change the function definition on the next line

    # NOTE: The following variables help in the implementation of the code
    # NOTE: TREAT THESE VARIABLES AS READ-ONLY!
    
    # ev parameters and variables are defined as follows:
    # evsoc              # State of Charge of the EV in kWh
    # evminsoc           # Minimum State of Charge of the EV in kWh (because of driving)
    # evcapacity         # Capacity of the EV in kWh
    # evpmin             # Minimum power of the EV in W = 0 W (EV cannot discharge. No V2G is possible.)
    # evpmax             # Maximum power of the EV in W
    # evenergy           # Energy consumption of the EV over one driving session in kWh

    # Timing variables are defined as follows:
    # evconnectiontime   # Hours the EV is connected
    # evarrivalhour      # Hour of arrival of the EV each day

    # Other input
    # The profile vector provides values in Watt for each discrete interval (to be complete, this is the average power consumption in W during an interval)
    # Negative values indicate overproduction.



    # Running the simulation of the device

    # Your task is to modify the code such that the list containing the resulting power profile is filled (this is the simulation outcome). 
    # This is also a list, with each value representing the power consumption (average) during an interval in Watts
    # The length of this list must be equal to the input vectors (i.e., planning)

    # For each interval i, these can be set by adding the correction value to the planning list, i.e.:
    # profile.append(<your_value>)
    # NOTE: Make sure that at the end the number of elements in profile equals the (original) length of the planning vector

    # NOTE: The given code does not include that the state of charge (SoC) of the EV battery is reduced due to driving
    # For this assignment you will need to implement SoC bookkeeping yourself and ensure that it stays within capacity bounds 
    # Tip: Use the "evenergy" variable for this in your code

    # What is already given is to determine if the EV is connected to the charging station (at home) or not (driving)
